education:
    - degree: Master of Data Science
      university: The University of British Columbia
      time: Completion data is June 30, 2020
      details: |
        The Master of Data Science is crowned with a mentored group project based on real data
        and questions from a partner within or outside the university. Students formulate questions
        and design and execute a suitable analysis plan. The group then work collaboratively to produce
        a reproducible analysis pipeline, project report, presentation and possibly other products,
        such as a dashboard.
    - degree: MSc in Petroleum Engineering
      university: University of Alberta
      time: 2012 - 2014
      details: |
        A full-time research based program,worked on Enhanced oil/heavy-oil recovery using chemical and thermal
        methods. Worked on developing advanced technologies for the efficient depletion of unconventional oil 
        reserves through experimental and numerical methods.

experiences:
    - role: Research Engineer
      time: 2018 - 2019
      company: University of Alberta, Edmonton
      details: |
       Applied statistical techniques and regression analysis to identify set of parameters that lead to maximum 
       likelihood for production optimization.
       Developed an analytical tool (python) to screen reservoirs for potential application of enhanced oil recovery
       technology.
       
       
       
    - role: Petroleum Engineering consultant
      time: 2017 - 2018
